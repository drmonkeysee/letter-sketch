# letter-sketch

An in-browser ASCII sketch program. This is a small hobby project to help prototype rogue-like visuals for other hobby projects. Maybe someday it will be something bigger. Inspired by [REXPaint](https://www.gridsagegames.com/rexpaint/) and a desire to play with the latest JavaScript tooling.
